# One-Dimensional Scrabble

A Python programming project of Scrabble restricted on a single row that is already partially filled with letters. This makes for a fun and interesting programming exercise for CS students in second or third year. Which combinatorial search technique produces the highest scoring answers? How well would the greedy algorithm and local search algorithms fare against more refined techniques? 

Given a Scrabble row as a string such as `'--o----v---c---i--b-l--i-n-u-y-'`, the function that the students implement should return a string with some of the blanks replaced with letters under the constraint that every maximal word that appears in the returned string is a legal word in the wordlist. The goal is to maximize the total score of the row, when each word gets points both for its Scrabble value and the square of its length. For example, `'-convolvulic-trilobal-signeury-'` would be one pretty well-scoring solution for this particular row.
